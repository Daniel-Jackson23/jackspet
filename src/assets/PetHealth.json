    "description": "Why you should brush your dogs teeth, It is estimated that over 2/3 of dogs over the age of three have periodontal disease, an inflammation or infection of the tissues surrounding the teeth. Periodontal disease starts as gingivitis caused by plaque and often progresses to involve the bony tooth sockets. Left untreated, periodontal disease can lead to painful tooth loss. Brushing their teeth twice a day can help remove plaque and prevent tartar accumulation as well as reducing bad breath of your dog. It is recommend that you tech your dog to accept tooth brushing while he or she is still young, having a older dog can become more challenging with the training process.",
